## Week 10 (March 10, 2021): Networking

# Review: Docker Container with Enviro

To start a Docker container with ENVIRO pre-loaded into it, do:

```bash
docker run -p80:80 -p8765:8765 -v $PWD:/source -it klavins/enviro:alpha bash
esm start
```

The above commands do the following:

- The `-p80:80 option maps _port_ 80 from the Docker container to ports on your host computer. This should allow you to go to

  > http://localhost
  > with your web browser and see the ENVIRO client. It should say "Error: Failed to fetch. Is the server running?" at this point.

- The `-p8765:8765` option allows the ENVIRO client to communicate with the `enviro` server (not yet running) via a _WebSocket_.

- The command `esm start` uses the <u>e</u>nviro <u>s</u>etup <u>m</u>anager to start a web server from which your browser can access the ENVRIO client.

# Review: Creating a Project

To create a new project, use `esm` as follows:

```bash
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
esm init
```

This will create the following directories and files

```
Makefile
config.json
defs/
    README.md
lib/
    README.md
src/
    Makefile
```

Make the project and start the enviro server as follows.

```bash
make
enviro
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost` you should see a rectangular walled area.

You can press `Ctrl-C` to stop the enviro server.

# Review: The Agent Interface

The `AgentInterface` class allows classes that derive from it to use the following methods:

```c++
// State
cpVect position();
cpVect velocity();
cpFloat angle();
cpFloat angular_velocity();

// Id
int id();

// Actuators
void apply_force(double thrust, double torque);
void track_velocity(double linear_velocity, double angular_velocity,
                    double kL=10, double kR=200);
void damp_movement();
void move_toward(double x, double y, double vF=10, double vR=200);
void teleport(double x, double y, double theta);

// Sensors
double sensor_value(int index);
std::vector<double> sensor_values();
```

For these methods to be available to a `Process/AgentInterface` object `c`, you **must** call

```c++
add_process(c)
```

from within the `Agent` constructor.

For example, try replacing `track_velocity` with something like `move_toward(0,0)` in the `MyRobot` class.

Client Events

When you click on something in the ENVIRO client, an event is sent back to ENVIRO server. These events are one of the following:

- **_screen_click_** events with values of the form

  ```json
  {
    "x": 123,
    "y": 234
  }
  ```

  where the x,y values are the position in the client where the mouse was clicked.

- **_agent_click_** events with values of the form

  ```json
  {
    "x": 12,
    "y": 23,
    "id": 3
  }
  ```

  In this case, the x,y position is the position on the agent where the mouse was clicked, and the `id` is an integer identifying the agent.

Using Click Events

Here is an example of how to use the click events. First, make a new project

```bash
cd ..
mkdir chaser
cd chaser
esm init
esm generate Chaser
esm generate Target
```

Change `defs/chaser.json` so that it uses the `MyRobot` shape from the previous example.

Add a chaser and a target to `config.json`.

Test with `enviro` to see if you get a robot and a block.

# Watch for Click Events

In `src/target.h`, you can make the target watch and respond to click events as follows:

```c++
class TargetController : public Process, public AgentInterface {

    public:
    TargetController() : Process(), AgentInterface() {}

    void init() {
        watch("screen_click", [this](Event e) {
            teleport(e.value()["x"], e.value()["y"], 0);
            emit(Event("goal_change", {
                { "x", e.value()["x"] },
                { "y", e.value()["y"] }
            }));
        });
    }

    void start() {}
    void update(){
        damp_movement();
    }
    void stop() {}

};
```

When the user clicks on the screen, the `Target` agent moves to that location, and emits a `goal_change` event, which we will respond to in a minute.

Compile this code and test to see the target move.

# Chase the Target

To get the robot to move, change the `ChaserController` to

```c++
class ChaserController : public Process, public AgentInterface {

    public:
    ChaserController() : Process(), AgentInterface() {}

    void init() {
        goal_x = 0;
        goal_y = 0;
        watch("goal_change", [this](Event e) {
            goal_x = e.value()["x"];
            goal_y = e.value()["y"];
        });
    }
    void start() {}
    void update() {
        move_toward(goal_x, goal_y);
    }
    void stop() {}

    double goal_x, goal_y;

};
```

# State Machines

You can use finite state machines in ENVIRO code as well. As an example, let's build a robot controller that has two states

- MoveForward
- Rotate

and that switches between the two states and random times.

First, we'll need a new project

```c++
cd ..
mkdir wanderer
cd wanderer
esm init
esm generate Wanderer
```

# Changing the Controller to a State Machine

In the `WandererController` class, change the base class from `Process` to `StateMachine`:

```c++
class WandererController : public StateMachine, public AgentInterface {
  public:
  WandererController() : StateMachine() {
      ...
```

# Switching at Random Times

To emit events that will eventually cause the state to change, we can override the `WandererController::update()` method with something like

```c++
void update() {
    if ( rand() % 100 <= 5 ) {
        emit(Event("tick"));
    }
    StateMachine::update();
}
```

This condition in the `if` statement is true only about 5% of the time, so only occasiinally ticks. The last line in the update function ensures that the superclass, `StateMachine`, has a chance to run its `update` method as well.

# The States

We then create states

```c++
    class MovingForward : public State, public AgentInterface {
        void entry(const Event& e) {}
        void during() {}
        void exit(const Event& e) {}
    };

    class Rotating : public State, public AgentInterface {
        void entry(const Event& e) {}
        void during() {}
        void exit(const Event& e) {}
    };
```

and add them to the state machine via instance variables.

```c++
    class WandererController : public StateMachine, public AgentInterface {
        // rest of code not shown
        MovingForward moving_forward;
        Rotating rotating;
    };
```

# The Transitions

The initial state and transitions are added to the constructor:

```c++
WandererController() : StateMachine() {
    set_initial(moving_forward);
    add_transition("tick", moving_forward, rotating);
    add_transition("tick", rotating, moving_forward);
}
```

# Adding Movement

In the `MovingForward` state, we move forward:

```c++
void during() {
    track_velocity(10, 0);
}
```

and in the `Rotating` state, we rotate

```c++
void during() {
    track_velocity(0,1);
}
```

Compiling and running this code should show a robot wandering around the arena.

# Sensors

You can add a range sensor to a wanderer by modifyin `defs/wanderer.json`:

```json
"sensors": [
    {
        "type": "range",
        "location": { "x": 16, "y": 0 },
        "direction": 0
    }
]
```

This will create a range sensor, like a laser range finder, sticking out of the front of the robot (angle 0). You can then access the value of the sensor using

```c++
double v = sensor_value(0);
```

# Updating the Wanderers

The wandering robot gets stuck a lot. One way to fix this is to change the state functions to something like:

```c++
class MovingForward : public State, public AgentInterface {
    public:
    void entry(const Event& e) {}
    void during() {
        track_velocity(4,0); // Go forward
        if ( sensor_value(0) < 40 ) {
            emit(Event("ping"));
        }
    }
    void exit(const Event& e) {}
};

class Rotating : public State, public AgentInterface {
    public:
    void entry() {}
    void during() {
        track_velocity(0,2); // Rotate
        if ( sensor_value(0) > 140 ) {
            emit(Event("ping"));
        }
    }
    void exit(const Event& e) {}
};
```

In the `WandererController` constructor you would then have

```c++
add_transition("ping", moving_forward, rotating);
add_transition("ping", rotating, moving_forward);
```
# Internet Protocols

## IP

The "Internet Protocols" suite of protocols for communicating among computers on the internet. Raw addresses such as 127.23.4.1 for the basis of how computers find each other via routers and routing tables. IP includes other protocols such as UDP and TCP.

## UDP

UDP stands for "User Datagram Protocol". It is used for low latency commucation of byte packets and messages between devices on an ethernet and/or the Internet. Messages sent with UDP arrive in order, but are not guaranteed to be delivered. Information such as real time voice and video are common applications.

## TCP

TCP stands for "Transmission Control Protocol". It is used for everything else. Messages are broken into packets and sent from one computer to another via routers. Acknowledgments of packet delivery are sent back to the sender. Each packet may take a different route. Failures occur due to over-taxed routers, and result in packets being resent. The rate at which packets are sent is adjusted according to the packet loss rate: every time a packet is lost, the packet send rate is cut in half. Every time a packet is not lost, the rate is incremented by a small amount (up to some limit).

# Web Protocols

## HTTP

HTTP stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol". It sits on top of TCP, meaning that it is simply a specification of the format of the messages that are sent back and forth using TCP. It was originally devloped for serving web pages, thus the term hypertext in the name. However, it has developed into a standard for sending data of any kind -- web pages, images, movies, json data, and so on -- in a reliable way. HTTP also specifies how Internet resources are named, using "Uniform Resource Locators" such as http://www.google.com instead of raw IP address.

## HTTPS

A secure version of HTTP that also uses the "Transport Layer Secutiry" (TLS) or "Secure Socket Layer" (SSL) to communcate. TLS and SSL sit on top of TCP, but encrypt packets before sending them. HTTPS can be either "simple", in which the server publishes a public key, or "mutual" in which case both sides publish public keys. Servers must additionally register with a trusted third party "certificate authority" to prevent spoofing of the service.

# Clients and Servers

- _Server_: An http server is a program that listens for incoming messages on a "port". Ports are just numbers the operating system uses to direct incomping IP traffic. For example, http usually runs on port 80, https on port 443, telnet on 23, ssh on 22, etc. Servers receive requests for data and "serve" the result. An example of an http server is the Apache Server. But you can make your own http server with a few lines of code.

- _Clients_: An http client is a program that connects to a server (or multiple servers), to request data or to upload data to a server. An example of a client is your web browser. But a robot in a factory or a satillite could also be clients.

- _Request Format_: Requests are text strings that include

  - A request line, like "GET /klavins/ECEP520 HTTP/1.1" which says to get a particular file or resource from the server.
  - Any number of request header fields (key value pairs). For example, you might add "User-Agent: Elma" so the server knows what kind of client is connecting.
  - An empty line.
  - An optional request body, where you might put data for an upload, etc., encoded as text

- _Response Format_: Responses are similar and include
  - A status, like "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" or "HTTP/1.1 404 Not found"
  - Any numbner of response headers, for example "content-type: json"
  - A blank line
  - A message body encoded as text

# Enviro Architecture

The command `esm start` starts an off the shelf web server on port 80. When you navigate to `http://localhost`, the web server returns the enviro web page, which includes a set of javascript program written using the React javascript library. In this case, your web browser is the client, and the web server (running in the container) is the server.

Once the browser receives the web page, it runs the javascript program, which is then another client. It talks directly to the `enviro` server over port 8765. The enviro server erturns information about the configuration of the simulation, and the positions of all the agents.

# Get Requests

A GET request looks like
`GET /klavins/ECEP520 HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: chrome`
an is used to request a datum with a simple name that can be specified in a path. For example, the one in the previous sentence asks ther server running at github.com to send back the main HTML page for our class' repository.

Enviro responds to two get requests

```
http://localhost:8765/config
http://localhost:8765/state
```

# Post Requests

A POST request might look like like

```
POST /save HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Elma
content-type: json

{
    "x": 123.4,
    "y": 234.5,
    "type": "screen_click"
}
```

Enviro responds to one POST request

```
http://localhost:8765/event
```

with a body of the form show above, for example.

# Other Requests

HTTP also defines PUT, DELETE, and PATCH, which together form the basis of what is called a Restful interface. Rest stands for "Representational State Transfer". For now, GET and POST are sufficient for most purposes, with specific actions like "delete" defined either in the url path or in a JSON message body.

# Web Sockets

The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

Enviro uses the `uWebSockets` library for its communication between the client and server.

# The Curl Client

An incredibly useful tool installed on pretty much any unix like environment (including our docker pages) is `curl`. Curl allows you to send get and post requests to servers. For example, to do a simple GET request, do

```bash
curl https://www.google.com
```

will return the http for Google's main page.

You can also do a POST request, as in

```bash
curl -d '{ "x": 123, "y": 234, "temperature": 41.2 }' -X POST localhost:8080/save
```

which we will use in an example below.

More interestingly, you can use Google's data API to get all sorts of interesting data. For example, see [here](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/using-curl). Note, charges apply. Other data services at Amazon, NOAA, Github, etc. are similar.

# Talking to Enviro

With enviro running, try

```
curl localhost:8765/config
```

or

```
curl -d '{ "type": "screen_click",  "x": 10, "y": 20 }' -X POST localhost:8765/event
```

# Using HTTP

One option for HTTP in C++ is [httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib)

C and C++ provide low level access to UDP and TCP with the 'socket' library. An example of low level socket programming can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/). It is a good place to start if you are developing a new protocol on top of TCP or UDP. But for communicating with HTTP, it is too low level, as it does not handle the request and response formats above, and does not know anything about GET and POST.

There are a myriad of libraries for dealing with HTTP in C++. A nice one that has a clean interface is called `cpp-httplib`. I have made a branch of this library and started to hack it a bit for use with Elma [here](https://github.com/klavins/cpp-httplib). In particular, I have added an exception class and started to add exception throws to the library, which uses return values to denote errors instead of exceptions (a very old C idea).

Examples of how to use cpp-httplib to make a simple server and client are [here](https://github.com/klavins/cpp-httplib).

# A Simple Database Server

As an example of what a server might do in an embedded systems or robotics setting, consider a scenario where a number of robots are exploring or surveying an area. Say they each have temperature sensors. To get a global picture of how the temperature is changing over space and time, the robots could upload their coordinates and the temperature to a server. To provide this service this, we will make a server that responds to two types of request.

- A POST request of the form `{ "x": 123, "y": 234, "temperature": 41.2 }` sent to the route `/save`
- A GET request to routes of the form `/find/42` that, in this case, returns the 42nd temperature reading

A simple database like data structue is defined as follows:

```c++
std::map<int, // id
    std::tuple<
       int,      // timestamp
       double,   // x position
       double,   // y position
       double    // temperature
    >
> database;
```

# Responding to POST Requests

To respond to the POST requests, we

- Parse the JSON request (returning an error if it is malformed)
- Update the database
- Respond to the client with information about what was done

In code, this looks like

```c++
svr.Post("/save", [&](const Request& req, Response& res) {

    json request, result;

    try {
        request = json::parse(req.body);
    } catch(json::exception e) {
        result["result"] = "error";
        result["message"] = e.what();
        res.set_content(result.dump(), "json");
        return;
    }

    database[next_id] = std::make_tuple(
        unix_timestamp(),
        request["x"].is_number() ? (double) request["x"] : 0,
        request["y"].is_number() ? (double) request["y"] : 0,
        request["temperature"].is_number() ? (double) request["temperature"] : 0
    );

    result["result"] = "ok";
    result["id"] = next_id++;
    res.set_content(result.dump(), "json");

});
```

# Responding to GET Requests

To respond to GET requests, we look up the id in the database, and return the resulting tuple in json.

```c++
svr.Get(R"(/find/(\d+))", [&](const Request& req, Response& res) {
    auto id = std::stoi(req.matches[1].str());
    json result;
    if ( database.find(id) != database.end() ) {
        result = {
            { "result", "ok" },
            { "id", id },
            { "timestamp", std::get<0>(database[id]) },
            { "x", std::get<1>(database[id]) },
            { "y", std::get<2>(database[id]) },
            { "temperature", std::get<3>(database[id]) }
        };
    } else {
        result["result"] = "error";
        result["message"] = "not found";
    }
    res.set_content(result.dump(), "json");
});
```

# Using the Server

To test the server, we'll map the port 8080 in the docker container to the port 80 on the host, by restarting the docker container with

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080/tcp -v $PWD:/source -it klavins/ecep520:cppenv-http bash
```

Note that the new Dockerfile also includes a directive to expose 8080 to the host with `EXPOSE 8080`.

Next, do `make bin/temperature_server` in the examples directory and then run `bin/temperature_server`. This will tie up the terminal, so you'll need another terminal to test it. If you have a Mac, you can just open a terminal and run

```bash
curl -d '{ "x": 123, "y": 234, "temperature": 41.2 }' -X POST localhost:8080/save
```

or

```c++
curl localhost:8080/find/1
```

# Adding HTTP to Elma

THIS IS FOR YOUR INFORMATION ONLY. ENVIRO DOES NOT USE THIS AND THERE IS NO HOMEWORK ON THIS.

It is tempting to add cpp-httplib directly to Elma and allow processes to use the `Get` method it provides for Clients directory. However, doing so raises two issues:

- The `Get` method of cpp-httplib blocks. That is, until the data is sent from the client to the server and back, nothing happens in the client program. Depending on how long this takes, it will block all other processes' `update` methods.
- We don't want the callback function for `Get` to run at arbitrary times (like in the middle of an update), but rather at a specified time in the main loop, like just before all processes are updated.
- We might decide to swap out cpp-httplib later, so we should define our own interface to http for Elma so that the backend can be easily changed later.

The third issue is easily solved by creating a new class. But the first two issues requires some new concepts.

# Threads

When you want multiple things to happen at once in C or C++, such as updating processes and waiting for a TCP response, you use [std::thread](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/thread/thread/). Use `#include <thread>`. Here is an example:

```c++
void do_something(int x, int y) {
    // suppose this takes a while
    // and we don't need the result
}

int main() {

  std::thread t1(do_something, 1, 2);
  std::thread t2(do_something, 1, 2);

  t1.detach();
  t2.detach();

  // continue on doing something else
  // note: if the main function ends, it will
  // stop the threads, even if they haven't
  // completed.

  return 0;

}
```

# Waiting

You can also wait for the threads to complete, as with

```c++
int main() {

  std::thread t1(do_something, 1, 2);
  std::thread t2(do_something, 1, 2);

  // continue on doing stuff

  t1.join();
  t2.join();

  return 0;

}
```

In general, use `detach` if you don't intend to `join` them later.

# Race Conditions

One issue with threaded code is the possibility of _race conditions_, in which two or more processes access the same data structures in different orders depending on timing. Here is an example:

```c++
char buffer[301];
int index = 0;

void print_block (int n, char c) {
    for (int i=0; i<n; ++i) {
    buffer[index] = c;
    index++;
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(rand()%5));
    }
}

TEST(RACE,CONDITIONS) {

    buffer[300] = 0;
    std::thread t1 (print_block,150,'*');
    std::thread t2 (print_block,150,'$');
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    auto desired_result = std::string(150,'*') + std::string(150,'$');
    ASSERT_STREQ(desired_result.c_str(), buffer);

}
```

Running this test may sometimes work, but more often than not you will get an failed test report:

```
Expected equality of these values:
  desired_result.c_str()
    Which is: "*************************************************$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
  buffer
    Which is: "*$$**$$$*$$$**$*$$*$$*$*$$$*$$$**$*$*$$*$*$$**$*$$$$**$*$$*$$$****$*$*$$**$$*$***$$*$*$*$*$$$*$**$*$$$**"
```

# Enviro Race Condition Possibilities

Enviro runs two threads. The first is the manager, which continuously updates all process. The second is the 8765 server, which retursn state information and receives event notifications.

What sort of data structures do you think both of these threads have to access?

# Mutual Exclusion

To fix race conditions, we use a `mutex` (use `#include <mutex>`), which is a mutual exclusion lock. When a thread locks a mutex, it will be allowed to contiune with what it is doing without being interrupted until it unlocks the mutex. The fix for the above code is

```c++
std::mutex mtx;
char buffer[301];
int index = 0;

void print_block (int n, char c) {
    mtx.lock();
    for (int i=0; i<n; ++i) {
    buffer[index] = c;
    index++;
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1));
    }
    mtx.unlock();
}
```

which enables the test to pass.

# A Client Class for Elma

For our Client class, we provde a similar interface to cpp-httplib, but with different behavior:

- Get requests look like

  ```c++
  Client& get(std::string url, std::function<void(json&)> handler);
  ```

  We pass the entire URL and not specifiy the host and path separately.
  We expect a JSON result from the server, which our implementation will parse and supply to the handler.

- Our client's `get` method will be **non-blocking** so that it doesn't block the `Manager` main loop.
- The `get` method is run in a thread that does the following:
  - Parse the result.
  - Put it and a reference to the handler into a list of responses
- The `Manager` dispatches all new responses to their handlers each time through the main loop.

# Example

THIS IS FOR YOUR INFORMATION ONLY. ENVIRO DOES NOT USE THIS AND THERE IS NO HOMEWORK ON THIS.

```c++
class GetTester : public Process {
    public:
    GetTester() : Process("Get Tester") {}
    void init() {}
    void start() {
        got_response = false;
        http_get("https://api.github.com/repos/klavins/ecep520", [this](json& response) {
            got_response = true;
        });
    }
    void update() {}
    void stop() {
        ASSERT_EQ(true,got_response);
    }
    bool got_response;
};

TEST(Client,ProcessInterface) {
    Manager m;
    GetTester p;

# Enviro New Features Coming Soon

## Definitely

- Documentation
- get_x, get_y, get_angle instead of chipmunk
- Return identity with distance
- Respond to keyboard events
- Have an omni directional robot
- Other modes of control (path following, for example)
- Have non-physical objects (like buttons)
- Have invisible, non-physical objects (like a game controller that keeps the score or responds to collision events)
- The ability to dynamically spawn new and delete agents on the fly

## Maybe

- Change size or appearance of agents
- Change the center of the view and possibly the magnification
- Allow multiple users logged in from different clients
- Add words and other decorations

# Brainstorm

Now that you have worked with `enviro` for a week and have learned a bit about how it works, discuss

- What you might do with your project.
- What are some features you might need or like to have in enviro.

# Enviro Examples

Examples in the [enviro github repo](https://github.com/klavinslab/enviro):

- **_avoiders_**: Illustrates sensors, multiple copies of the same agent, decorations, and labels.

- **_new_agent_test_**: A simple demonstration of dynamically creating a new agent.

- **_platformer_**: Turns off rotations and demonstrates how to simulate gravity, jumping, and left/right movement. Uses sensors, collision handlers, and keyboard events.

- **_teleporter_**: Move an agent to an arbitrary location. Reponds to keyboard events.

- **_wanderers_**: Simpler version of avoiders demo.

- **_multiuser_**: Demonstrates how to have multiple players all logged in with separate web browsers. Also shows non-interactive and invisible elements.
- **_omni_**: Shows a few omni-directional agents moving and teleporting.

- **_virus_**: Demonstrates agent creation, and removal. Uses collision handlers and attachment constraints.

# Documentation

See the [README](https://github.com/klavinslab/enviro).

# Button Clicks

In `config.json`

> `buttons`<br>
> A list of buttons to show in the top right of the front end user interface. These should have the form
>
> ```json
> {
>   "name": "name",
>   "label": "Displayed Name",
>   "style": { "background": "white", "border-color": "black" }
> }
> ```

Your events:

> Name: `button_click`<br>
> Sent when a user clicks on a button. The buttons need to be defined in `config.json`. <br>
> Value: An object with the a `name` field that matches the name field used in `config.json`.

# Keyboard Events

> Name: `keydown`<br>
> Sent when a user presses a key down.<br>
> Value: An object with a `key` field, which is the character pressed, as well as the following boolean fields
>
> ```
> ctrlKey
> shiftKey
> altKey
> metaKey
> ```
>
> &#x2469; New in 1.0.

> Name: `keyup`<br>
> Sent when a user release a key.<br>
> Value: Same as for `keydown`.
> &#x2469; New in 1.0.

# Keyboard Example

```c++
void init() {
    watch("keydown", [&](Event &e) {
        auto k = e.value()["key"].get<std::string>();
        if ( k == "w" ) {
                f = magnitude;
        } else if ( k == "s" ) {
                f = -magnitude;
        } else if ( k == "a" ) {
                tau = -magnitude;
        } else if ( k == "d" ) {
                tau = magnitude;
        }
    });
    watch("keyup", [&](Event &e) {
        auto k = e.value()["key"].get<std::string>();
        if ( k == "w" || k == "s" ) {
                f = 0;
        } else if ( k == "a" ) {
                tau = 0;
        } else if ( k == "d" ) {
                tau = 0;
        }
    });
}
void update() {
    apply_force(f,tau);
}
double f, tau;
double const magnitude = 200;
```

# Omni Directional Robots

In `defs/your_robot.json` use

- "shape": "omni"
- "radius": 123

New methods:

- `void omni_apply_force(double fx, double fy)`
- `void omni_track_velocity(double vx, double vy, double k=10)`
- `void omni_damp_movement()`
- `void omni_move_toward(double x, double y, double v=1)`

See `examples/omni`.

# Collisions

`void notice_collisions_with(const std::string agent_type, std::function<void(Event&)> handler)`

Runs the handler function upon collisions with agents of the given agent type.
The `agent_type` string is the name used in `defs/*.json` files.
These should usually be set up in the `init` function of a process, as follows:

```c++
void init() {
    notice_collisions_with("Robot", [&](Event &e) {
        int other_robot_id = e.value()["id"];
        Agent& other_robot = find_agent(other_robot_id);
        // etc.
    });
}
```

The value associated with the event `e` is a json object with a single key, `id`, which is the id of the other agent.

`void ignore_collisions_with(const std::string agent_type)`

Stop noticing collisions with agents of the given type.

# Attaching

`void attach_to(Agent &other_agent)`

Create a constraint that attaches the calling agent to the `other_agent`.
For example, after the call

```c++
Agent& other_robot = find_agent(other_robot_id);
attach_to(other_robot);
```

the two agents center's will be constrained to remain at the same distance from each other.

# Agent Management

`Agent& find_agent(int id)`

Given an agent's id, returns a reference to the agent. Note: **_do not_** assign the return value of this function to a normal
variable, because when it goes out of scope, the agent's destructor will be called. Instead, assign it to a reference, as in

```c++
Agent& other_agent = find_agent(other_agent_id;
```

`bool agent_exists(int id)`

Returns true or false depending on whether an agent with the given id still exists (i.e. is being managed by enviro).
Agents may cease to exist if `remove_agent()` is called.

`void remove_agent(int id)`
Removes the agent with the given id from the simulation. Also calls it's desctructor, so think of it as remove and delete.

`Agent& add_agent(const std::string name, double x, double y, double theta, const json style)` <br>
Add's a new agent to the simulation with the given name at the given position and orientation.
Note that an agent with this type should have been mentioned in `config.json` so enviro knows about it.
The style argument determines the agent's style, just as in the configuration file.
Any valid svg styling will work. For example:

```c++
Agent& v = add_agent("Block", 0, 0, 0, {{"fill": "bllue"},{"stroke": "black"}});
```

# The Virus Example

Go to `examples/virus`

Sensor Reflection Types

`std::string sensor_reflection_type(int index)`

This method returns the name of object type the sensor of the specificed index is seeing. The index refers to the position in the sensor list in the agent's JSON definition.

std::vector<std::string> sensor_values()`
This method returns a list of all the sensor reflection types, in the same order as the sensors appear in the agent's JSON definition.

# Decorations and Labels

`void decorate(const std::string svg)`

Add an aribtrary svg element to the agent's rendering method on the client side.
The svg element will be transformed and rotated to the agent's coordinate system.
For example, to place a red dot in the middle of the agent do:

```c++
decorate("<circle x='-5' y='5' r='5' style='fill: red'></circle>");
```

To clear the decoration later, simple call

```c++
decorate("");
```

`void label(const string str, double x, double y )`

Add a textual label to the agent's icon. The x and y values are relative to the origin of the agent's coordinate system.

`void clear_label()`

Clear the label associated with the agent.

# Preventing Rotation

`void prevent_rotation()`

Prevents the agent from rotating. Probably best to call in the init function. Good for platformer type movement. Technically sets the moment of inertia to infinity.

`void allow_rotation()`

Allows the agent to rotate, setting the moment of inertia to the default number (based on the mass and shape of the agent).

See `examples/platformer`.

# New Agent Types

In the `defs/*.json` definitions, the type field can now be:

- "dynamic": the agent will move, have mass, etc.
- "static": the agent will not move but will still be something other agents will collide with (i.e. like a wall).
- "noninteractive": The agent will not by simulated with any physics. Other agents will pass through it.
- "invisible": The agent is noninteractive and invisible. It can be used to run background processes not associated with visible elements.

# The Client ID

Event Name: `connection`

Sent when a new client attaches to the enviro server.

Value: An object with a string valued `id` field that should be unique to the client that has connected.

Note: this ID will be sent with all other events as well.

# Example: Spawn new Player for Each Connection

```c++
class CoordinatorController : public Process, public AgentInterface {

    public:
    CoordinatorController() : Process(), AgentInterface() {}

    void init() {
        watch("connection", [&](Event e) {
            Agent& a = add_agent("Guy", 0, y, 0, {{"fill","gray"},{"stroke","black"}});
            a.set_client_id(e.value()["id"]);
            y += 50;
        });
    }
    void start() {}
    void update() {}
    void stop() {}

    double y = -150;

};
```

# Example: Filter Keyboard Events by Connection

In `guy.h`:

```c++
watch("keyup", [&](Event &e) {
    if ( e.value()["id"] == get_client_id() ) { // FILTER CLIENT!
        auto k = e.value()["key"].get<std::string>();
        if ( k == " " ) {
            firing = false;
        } else if ( k == "w" || k == "s" ) {
            f = 0;
        } else if ( k == "a" ) {
            tau = 0;
        } else if ( k == "d" ) {
            tau = 0;
        }
    }
});
```
