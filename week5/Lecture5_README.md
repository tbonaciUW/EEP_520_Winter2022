So far in the course we have covered the basics of C and C++, and focused in particular on writing abstract data types and classes that encapsulate data structures and the algorithms that act upon them. In particular, last week we introduced C++.

This week, we introduce data types, classes, and templates in C++ andthe C++ Standard Template Library (STL). It contains, among other things, a `vector` template that is just like one of the examples we are going to study, `TypedArray`, but scaled and optimized for production applications. The library includes varitions on templated, dynamic, sequential containers such as queues, lists, and arrays. It also includes maps, sets, and a set of generic algoprithms you can use to operate on these objects. Most C++ programs make heavy use of these templates and algorithms, avoiding dynamic memory management as much possible. These week we will introduce these templates at a high level. The complete documentation for the STL can be found at [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/).

Next week, we will begin to focus on the types and classes needed to represent common tasks in embedded systems. We will introduce classes for sensors, effectors, processes, a process manager, and a scheduler. Together, these classes will allow us to write complex, event driven, reactive systems that are at the heart of embedded systems and robotics control systems. We will build the classes and modules we need to implement these ideas almost exclusively using the STL.

# References

Essentially an alias for a variable, references allow you to refer to the same object with a different name:

```c++
int x = 1;
int &y = x;
```

Note that we are defining `y` to refer to `x`. You can't just do

```c++
int &z
```

because you are not saying what `z` refers to.

You can now do anything with `y` that you can with `x`. For example,

```c++
x = 3;
y == x; // true
y = 4;
x == y; // true
```

## References are not pointers

- References are much safer!
- They are not used for memory management (like pointers are)!
- There is no "reference arithmetic"
- They are just synonyms

## References in Function Arguments

References are most useful in functions to make an argument _call by reference_ instead of _call by value_.

For example, the method `magnitude` defined below takes a const reference to a point.

```c++
typedef struct {
    double x, y, z;
} Point;

double magnitude(const Point &p) {
    return sqrt(p.x*p.x + p.y*p.y + p.z*p.z);
}
```

You can use this method without caring that it is call by reference, as in:

```c++
Point p = { 0,3,4 };
ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ(magnitude(p), 5);
```

The benefit is speed. If you call by value, then the entire point structure, with its three doubles, is copied to call the function. With call by reference, only a reference is created, which is a much smaller object. Note that almost every modern scripted language, such as Python and Javascript, use call by reference for arrays, hashes, and other objects, because these objects can get quite large and copying them every time you call a function is innefficient.

## Returning a Reference

A function can also return a reference. For example, suppose you want to compare the magnitudes of two points and return the one with a smaller magnitude. Copying all those points is a waste of time and space, so we use references instead. For example, if `smaller` is defined as

```c++
Point &smaller(Point &p, Point &q) {
    if ( magnitude(p) <= magnitude(q) ) {
        return p;
    } else {
        return q;
    }
}
```

then you can write

```c++
Point &r = smaller(p,q);
```

after which `r` will refer to the smaller of the two points. Let's say `p` is smaller. If you then do

```c++
r.x = -1;
```

you will also be setting `p.x`.

# WARNING

Do not return a reference to a locally declared variable. Local variables are deleted from memory when the function completes, so you would be returning a reference to nothing. For example:

```c++
Point &f() {
    Point p = {1,2,3};
    Point &q = p;
    return q;
}
```

will compile just fine, but is meaningless to the point of dangerous.

# Namespaces

In C++ the notion of a namespace was introduced to avoid cluttering the global namespace with lots of function and type definitions. One of the main namespaces we will use is `std`, which is the namespace the standard library uses. For example, the C++ method `cout`, which is used for printing (instead of `printf`) is a method declared in the `std` namespace. To use it, you have to do use the `::` operator, which accesses the namespace.

```c++
#include <iostream>

// later ...
std::cout << "Hello world\n";
```

This may look just like added `std_` to the beginning of everything, but you can open a namespace to use its methods for the duration of a function, as in

```c++
void print_stuff() {
    using namespace std;
    cout << "First line\n";
    cout << "Second line\n";
}
```

## Creating Namespaces

Put your library of functions and datatypes in a namespace. In this example, we avoid potential name collisions with "Point" and "mag" that may be defined some other way elsewhere.

```c++
namespace my_library {
    typedef struct {
        double x, y;
    } Point;
    int mag(Point &p) {
        return sqrt(p.x*p.x + p.y*p.y);
    }
}
```

Then use the library

```c++
namespace {
    TEST(Examples, MyLibrary) {
        my_library::Point p = { x: 3, y: 4};
        ASSERT_NEAR(my_library::mag(p), 5, 0.00001);
    }
    TEST(Examples, Using) {
        using namespace my_library;
        Point p = { x: 3, y: 4};
        ASSERT_NEAR(mag(p), 5, 0.00001);
    }
}
```

# Throwing Exceptions

One of the big difficulties in C is what to do when some exception occurs at run time. Usually, developers handle this by either returning a special value, such as NULL or -1, from a function in which an error occurred, or by setting up an error data structure inside an ADT to keep track of errors (like we did with the rpn calculator).

In C++, however, you can define exception handlers explicitly, as well as either choose to ignore exceptions (so they are passed to the function that calls you function), or handle them explicitly. Here is an example of how to throw an exception

```c++
#include <stdexcept>

double invert(int x, int y) {
    if ( x == 0 ) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("First argument cannot be zero");
    } else {
        return y/x;
    }
}
```

# Catching (and Testing) Exceptions

This code throws an exception in some cases. The particular exception it throws has a type `std::invalid_argument`, which is an ADT defined in the `<stdexcept>` library. There are several other exceptions in the library as well, which you can read about [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stdexcept/). We will discuss defining new types of exceptions later in the class. To catch this exception, you would do something like:

```c++
try {
    invert(0,1);
    ASSERT_EQ(true,false);
} catch (std::invalid_argument e ) {
    ASSERT_STREQ(e.what(), "First argument cannot be zero");
}
```

# Failing to Catch Exceptions

Note that if you do not catch an exception in a given function, it is passed up to the function that called it, all the way up to the operating system. For example, suppose you had another function

```c++
void show(x,y) {
    std::cout << invert(x,y) << "\n";
}
```

If whatever function calls `show` sends in a zero for the first argument, then `invert` will throw an exception. Since this exception is not handled in `show` it will be passed up the chain to whatever called show. Thus, you can do:

```c++
try {
    show(0,1);
} catch (std::invalid_argument e ) {
   // do something here
}
```

And if you do not look for any exceptions, you will end up with a runtime error.

Conveniently, Google Test will catch all exceptions and the tests that produced them as failures, print out the exception's `what` method, and proceed without crashing the whole program. To use them, just do

# Standard Exceptions

The `<exception>` library defines some standard excptions you can use in your code.

```c++
throw std::invalid_argument("First argument cannot be zero");
```

to throw. All these exceptions define a `what()` method, which you can use when catching.

```c++
catch (std::invalid_argument e ) {
    std::cout << e.what() << "\n";
}
```

**Available Exceptions:**

<pre>
logic_error                    invalid_argument              domain_error, 
length_error                   out_of_range                  future_error(C++11)
bad_optional_access(C++17)     runtime_error                 range_error
overflow_error                 underflow_error               regex_error(C++11)
system_error(C++11)            ios_base::failure(C++11)      filesystem::filesystem_error(C++17), 
tx_exception(TM TS)            nonexistent_local_time(C++20) ambiguous_local_time(C++20), 
format_error(C++20)            bad_typeid                    bad_cast
bad_any_cast(C++17)            bad_weak_ptr(C++11)           bad_function_call(C++11)
bad_alloc                      bad_array_new_length(C++11)   bad_exception
ios_base::failure(until C++11) bad_variant_access(C++17).
</pre>

**Note:** You can also define your own exception class (more on this later in the course).

# Memory Allocation in C++

Memory allocation in C++ is handled by the language, and not by a library of methods as with `malloc`. Two operators, `new` and `delete` handle everything. For example:

```c++
int * x = new int;
double * p = new double[10];

// later ...
delete x;
delete[] p;
```

Note that unlike `malloc`, `new` returns a pointer to a specific type of object.

In the first case an `int` and in the second case an array of `doubles`.

You do not need to cast anything. No `void *` pointers!

The benefit is that C++ will do some type checking for you and report compile time errors that C could not. Also note that when you delete an object, you have to use the corresponding form.

To delete a single object, use `delete` and to delete an array, use `delete[]`.

# Classes and Objects

C++ solves the problem of having objects own their methods with classes. A `class` is a description of an abstract data type's data structures and methods all within one `struct`-like entity. As an example of a class, we can write the array class we have been working on as follows:

```c++
class DoubleArray {

public:

    // Constructors
    DoubleArray();
    DoubleArray(double a, double b, double step);     // replaces the _range method
    DoubleArray(const DoubleArray& other);            // replaces the _copy method

    // Assignment operator
    DoubleArray& operator=(const DoubleArray& other); // new! lets you do array2 = array1;

    // Destructor
    ~DoubleArray();                        // Replaces destroy, deleting the buffer
                                           // and also deletes the array object itself.

    // Getters
    double get(int index) const;           // Notice all our methods now do not
    int size() const;                      // take a pointer to the array as the
                                           // first object. The object is implicit.
                                           // The trailing "const" in some methods says
                                           // the object will not be changed by the
                                           // method.
    // Setters
    void set(int index, double value);

private:

    int capacity,                          // Our data goes here. It is private, meaning
        origin,                            // the user cannot access it.
        end;

    double * buffer;

    const int INITIAL_CAPACITY = 10;       // Instead of a global #define, we use an class
                                           // defined constant, that is only available within
                                           // the class

    int index_to_offset(int index) const;  // No more static methods! These will be available
    int offset_to_index(int offset) const; // to the class, but not the user.
    bool out_of_buffer(int offset) const;
    void extend_buffer(void);

};
```

The above essentially defines the interface to our new class. It says what methods are available and what arguments they take. It also defines some private data that only the class methods will have access to.

# Using Classes to Make Objects

To use the `DoubleArray` class, we would do something like:

```c++
TEST(DoubleArray, Construction) {
    DoubleArray a,             // use the default constructor
                b(0,1,0.1);    // use the range constructor
    a.set(4, 1);               // use the dot operator to access the `set` method
    ASSERT_EQ(b.get(2), 0.2);  // use the dot operator to access the `get` method
}
```

Notice that we do not have to explicitly delete `a` and `b` when we are done with them. This is because when they go out of scope, C++ will automatically call the method `~DoubleArray`, which is specially named with the `~` to let C++ know to call it whenever it needs to delete a `DoubleArray`.

# Allocating new Objects

On the other hand, we still need to use `delete` if we happened to use `new` to allocate a `DoubleArray`. For example,

```c++
auto a = new DoubleArray();
auto b = new DooubleArray(0,1,0.25);

// later ...
delete a, b;
```

Note that when declaring pointers to objects, you can write

```c++
auto c = new DoubleArray; // Compiles, but does not call the constructor! Bad!
```

in which case you get an object of type `DoubleArray` for which the constructor has not been called. Since in our case, the constructor allocated memory, the result of the above code is a `DoubleArray` in which the buffer is uninitialized. Which is bad!

# Constructors

The constructor in a class is responsible for

- initializing variables
- allocating memory (if needed)
  If the objects constructed do not need memory allocation, then C++ provides a default constructor, so you do not need to define one. For example, if you defined class as

```c++
class Complex {
    private:
      double re, im;
};
```

then you can simple make a new Imaginary number with

```c++
Complex x;
```

# Multiple Constructors

You can add constructors that do different initializations. For example, the code

```c++
class Complex {
    public:
      Complex(double a, double b) : re(a), im(b) {};
      Complex(double a) : re(a), im(0) {};
    private:
      double re, im;
};
```

defines two new constructors. They do C++ initialization syntax to initialize the `re` and `im` fields. The first is equivalent to

```c++
Complex(double a, double b) {
    re = a;
    im = b;
}
```

so there is nothing magical about the syntax. Notice that the two constructors have the same name. C++ can tell the difference between them by what arguments are passed. In fact, there is a third constructor, the default constructor, which takes no arguments (as before). Thus, you can write:

```c++
  Complex w, x(), y(1,2), z(3);
```

and C++ will know which constructor to use.

# Memory Allocation in Constructors

If memory needs to be allocated, you must at least override the default constructor (the one that takes no arguments). In the `DoubleArray` class we defined the constructor:

```c++
DoubleArray();
```

which we implement in `dynamic_array.cc` with

```c++
DoubleArray::DoubleArray() {                     // Note the namespace :: operator
    buffer = new double[INITIAL_CAPACITY]();     // We use new instead of calloc
    capacity = INITIAL_CAPACITY;                 // Note that we can refer to member variables
    origin = capacity / 2;                       // like buffer, capacity, origin, and end
    end = origin;                                // implicitly. C++ knows what we mean.
}
```

Note that the contructor does not explictly return a value. In fact, it is called after an object is created either in a variable declaration or when using `new`.

# A Range Constructor

The other constructors can build on this code, without having to do everything again, by using the initialization syntax to initialize the object being constructed using the default constructor (the one with no arguments), and then adding more to the object in the body of the function.

```c++
DoubleArray::DoubleArray(double a, double b, double step) : DoubleArray() {
    int i = 0;
    for ( double x=a; x<=b; x += step ) {
        set(i, x);
        i+=1;
    }
}
```

# Operator Overloading

To declare a binary operator, such as `==`, we do:

```c++
bool operator==(const DoubleArray& a, const DoubleArray& b) {
    if ( a.size() != b.size() ) {
        return false;
    }
    for(int i=0; i<a.size(); i++) {
        if ( a.get(i) != b.get(i) ) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

bool operator!=(const DoubleArray& a, const DoubleArray& b) {
    return !(a==b);
}
```

You can now use ASSERT_EQ with arrays.

```c++
TEST(DoubleArray, Equality) {
    DoubleArray a(0,1,0.1), b(0,1,0.1), c(1,2,0.1);
    ASSERT_EQ(a, b);
    ASSERT_NE(a,c);
}
```

For more details, see [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operators).

# Assignment

To support syntax like the following

```c++
  DoubleArray x(0,1,0.1), y;
  y = x;
```

C++ needs to know what it means to assign one `DoubleArray` to have the value of another. What we want `=` to mean is

- delete the buffer in y
- allocate a new buffer in y
- copy the contents of the buffer in x to the buffer in y
- initialize origin, end, etc.

# Overloading "=", a.k.a. the Assignment Operator

```c++
DoubleArray& DoubleArray::operator=(const DoubleArray& other) {
    if ( this != &other) {
        delete[] buffer; // don't forget this or you'll get a memory leak!
        buffer = new double[other.capacity]();
        capacity = other.capacity;
        origin = other.origin;
        end = origin;
        for ( int i=0; i<other.size(); i++) {
            set(i,other.get(i));
        }
    }
    return *this;
}
```

Think of this code as defining a method called `=` that would be called with `set y to be =(x)` (psuedocode).
This method uses the keyword `this`, which refers to the object being operated on. In our C array class, we passed a pointer (usually called `da`) to the object as the first argument to every function. In C++ the pointer is implicit, but can be access if needed with `this`. In the above code, `this` refers to the assignee (the left hand side of `y=x`) and `other` refers to the object being copied. Thus, the first line checks that these two are not the same (if they are, there is nothing to do -- although you could leave this out and truely make a copy).

Also note that the method accesses the private members of `other`, which is okay because this is a class method.

# Returning Referenes

Finally, notice that the method returns a reference to the result of the copy. This is actually not needed to assign the left hand side (that's done in the body of the method), but is needed because an expression like `y=x` itself has a value, which should be a reference to `y`. This is so you can do things like

```c++
y = x = z;
```

which is equivalent to

```c++
y = (x = z);
```

Returning a reference to `*this` is called _method chaining_.

## Without Method Chaining

Here is an example.

```c++
class Arith {

    public:

    Arith() : _value(0) {}

    void &zero()          { _value  = 0; }
    void &add(int x)      { _value += x; }
    void &subtract(int x) { _value -= x; }
    void &multiply(int x) { _value *= x; }
    void &divide(int x)   { _value /= x; }

    int value() { return _value; }

    private:

    int _value;

};
```

Without method chaining you would have to write

```c++
Arith a;
a.add(1);
a.subtract(2);
ASSERT(a.value(), -1);
```

## With Method Chaining

Here is an example.

```c++
class Arith {

    public:

    Arith() : _value(0) {}

    Arith &zero()          { _value  = 0; return *this; }
    Arith &add(int x)      { _value += x; return *this; }
    Arith &subtract(int x) { _value -= x; return *this; }
    Arith &multiply(int x) { _value *= x; return *this; }
    Arith &divide(int x)   { _value /= x; return *this; }

    int value() { return _value; }

    private:

    int _value;

};
```

With method chaining you can do

```c++
Arith a;
ASSERT(a.add(1).subtract(2).value(),-1);
```

# The Copy Constructor

Using the assignment operator, we can define another constructor, called the copy constructor, as follows:

```c++
DoubleArray::DoubleArray(const DoubleArray& other) : DoubleArray() {
    *this = other;
}
```

It is quite common for these two methods to be intertwined thusly.

This would be used as in

```c++
DoubleArray x;
x.set(0,3.14); // etc
DoubleArray y(x); // sets y to be a copy of x.
```

# The Destructor

The destructor is responsible for deallocating memory.

If none of your constructors allocate memory, then _you do not need a destructor_.

However, if any constructors do allocate memory, then you have to have one. For ``DoubleArray` we just write

```c++
DoubleArray::~DoubleArray() {
    delete[] buffer;
}
```

Now, whenever a `DoubleArray` goes out of scope, its destructor is called. It is also called whenever `delete` is called on a `DoubleArray` made with `new`.

# Getters and Setters

The getters are straightforward. Notice that we can throw an exception instead of a runtime error when exceptions occur.

```c++
double DoubleArray::get(int index) const {
    if (index < 0) {
        throw std::range_error("Negative index in array");
    }
    if ( index >= size() ) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        return buffer[index_to_offset(index)];
    }
}

void DoubleArray::set(int index, double value) {
    if (index < 0) {
        throw std::range_error("Negative index in array");
    }
    while ( out_of_buffer(index_to_offset(index) ) ) {
        extend_buffer();
    }
    buffer[index_to_offset(index)] = value;
    if ( index >= size() ) {
        end = index_to_offset(index+1);
    }
}
```

# Templates

The `DoubleArray` class has the same issues as our C `DynamicArray` ADT did: it only contains doubles. However, C++ provides a powerful way to make new objects that refer to arbitrary types. The approach uses `templates`.

Here is an example of function definition that uses a template to compare two objects:

```c++
template<typename T>
int compare(const T& x, const T& y) {
    if ( x < y ) {
        return -1;
    } else if ( y < x ) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

As long as `<` is defined for the the type `T`, then this template can be used. For example,

```c++
int c = compare(1.0, 2.0)
int c = compare(1, 5);


DynamicArray a, b; //we need to instantiate and initialize this
int c = compare(a, b);
```

works.

# Comparisons for Defined Classes

```c++
Complex x(1,2), y(3,4);
int c = compare(x,y);
```

will give the error:

```bash
error: no match for 'operator<' (operand types are 'const {anonymous}::Complex' and 'const {anonymous}::Complex')
```

However, if you defined `<` for complex numbers as follows:

```c++
bool operator<(const Complex& a, const Complex& b) {
    return a.magnitude() < b.magnitude();
}
```

Then `compare` will work just fine.

# Templates for the Array Class

To apply templates to our array class, we have to replace references to `double` with a type name:

```c++
template <typename ElementType>                      // ElementType is the type variable
class TypedArray {

public:

    TypedArray();
    TypedArray(const TypedArray& other);

    // Copy constructor
    TypedArray& operator=(const TypedArray& other);

    // Destructor
    ~TypedArray();

    // Getters
    ElementType &get(int index);
    ElementType &safe_get(int index) const;         // This is new. See below.
    int size() const;

    // Setters
    void set(int index, ElementType value);

private:

    int capacity,
        origin,
        end;

    ElementType * buffer;

    const int INITIAL_CAPACITY = 10;

    int index_to_offset(int index) const;
    int offset_to_index(int offset) const;
    bool out_of_buffer(int offset) const;
    void extend_buffer(void);

};
```

# Using Templated Classes

With this definition of array, we can make arrays of anything.

```c++
TypedArray<Point> b;
b.set(0, Point(1,2,3));
b.set(1, Point(2,3,4));
b.set(20, Point(3,4,5));
double r = b.get(20).x;
```

Or, for an even nicer example, using arrays of arrays of doubles, we can make a matrix:

```c++
TypedArray<TypedArray<double>> m;

for (int i=0; i<30; i++) {
    for (int j=0; j<30; j++) {
        m.get(i).set(j,0.5*i*j);
    }
}
```

# Where to put Template Methods

<span style="background: yellow; padding: 10px">Template methods need to appear in header files.</span>

This is because the compiler can only compile things like `TypedArray<int>` and not arbitrary typed arrays. Thus, any file that uses a templated class needs to include all the templated methods, and not just the class definition, because compiling it will require instantiating the template on the specific types used in the file.

See `week_4/typed_array/typed_array.h`.

Note that there is no `typed_array.c` file!

# Memory Allocation with Arbitrary Types

The main difference between `DoubleArray` and `TypedArray` has to do with the buffer. For example, in the constructor, we can still use `new`, but we also have to make sure to call the constructor for whatever class `ElementType` stands for, which we do with with the parentheses at the end of the statement.

```c++
template <typename ElementType>
TypedArray<ElementType>::TypedArray() {
    buffer = new ElementType[INITIAL_CAPACITY](); // Note: Calls ElementType constructor
    capacity = INITIAL_CAPACITY;
    origin = capacity / 2;
    end = origin;
}
```

The same line shows up in the assignment operator, and a similar line shows up in the private method `extend_buffer`.

# Setting calls the copy constructor (if there is one)

With DoubleArray, setting a location in the array to a value copies the value, because that's how assignment works for `double`.

But with arbitrary element types, assignment calls the copy constructor.

```c++
template <typename ElementType>
void TypedArray<ElementType>::set(int index, ElementType value) {
    if (index < 0) {
        throw std::range_error("Negative index in array");
    }
    while ( out_of_buffer(index_to_offset(index) ) ) {
        extend_buffer();
    }
    buffer[index_to_offset(index)] = value; // Should call the copy
                                            // constructor of ElementType.
    if ( index >= size() ) {
        end = index_to_offset(index+1);
    }
}
```

We can check for the right behavior in a test.

```c++
TEST(TypedArray,CopyElementsInSet2) {
    TypedArray<TypedArray<double>> m;
    TypedArray<double> x;
    x.set(0,0);
    m.set(0,x);
    x.set(0,-1);
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(m.get(0).get(0),0.0); // If set didn't make a copy
                                            // then we would expect m[0][0]
                                            // to be x[0], which we changed
                                            // to -1.
}
```

# Default Values

Another issue is this: In the `DoubleArray` class, we used zero as the default value when the user asked for an element outside the size of the array. To do that here, we need a "zero" for any object.

One idea is to use the default constructor of the supplied type to create a new element to return in such cases, and also to extend pad array with default values all the way up to the newly accessed index:

```c++
template <typename ElementType>
ElementType &TypedArray<ElementType>::get(int index) {
    if (index < 0) {
        throw std::range_error("Out of range index in array");
    }
    if ( index >= size() ) {
                          // User is access beyond the end of the array,
                          // so return the default value.
        ElementType x;    // A temporary value to use with set.
        set(index, x);    // `set` will create a copy of the default values.
    }
    return buffer[index_to_offset(index)];
}
```

# Get Returns a Reference

For the line

```c++
m.get(i).set(j,0.5*i*j);
```

to work, the call to `get` cannot copy the array at index `i` in `m`, because then we would be changing a copy of the array when we called `set` after that. Thus, `get` should return a reference. Also, note that because `get` might actually change the array, the array iteself is not guaranteed to be the same after the get.

However, we may have other methods that expect getting an element at a particular index to leave the array unchanged, for example, when copying the array. Thus, we add a new method called `safe_get`:

```c++
template <typename ElementType>
ElementType &TypedArray<ElementType>::safe_get(int index) const {
    if (index < 0 || index >= size() ) {
        throw std::range_error("Out of range index in array");
    }
    return buffer[index_to_offset(index)];
}
```

Note the extra `const` at the end of the declaration. A `const` in that position refers to `this`, that is, the object that owns the method. Since the object itself is not an argument (it is only so implicitly), C++ uses this syntax to require the method to not change the underlying array data. This is required when copying an array using the assignment operator, because the argument `other` is specified to be a const.

# Using safe_get

An example where `safe_get` is needed is in the assignment operator.

```c++
template <typename ElementType>
TypedArray<ElementType>& TypedArray<ElementType>::operator=(const TypedArray<ElementType>& other) {
    if ( this != &other) {
        delete[] buffer; // don't forget this or you'll get a memory leak!
        buffer = new ElementType[other.capacity]();
        capacity = other.capacity;
        origin = other.origin;
        end = origin;
        for ( int i=0; i<other.size(); i++) {
            set(i,other.safe_get(i));
        }
    }
    return *this;
}
```

In the above method, if we replace `safe_get` with just `get` we get the (extremely helpful) compile time error:

```bash
error: passing 'const TypedArray<double>' as 'this' argument of
'ElementType& TypedArray<ElementType>::get(int) [with ElementType = double]'
discards qualifiers [-fpermissive]
```

The term "discards qualifiers" refers to the `const` after the method declaration. The last bit is a suggestion that you compile with the `g++` flag `-fpermissive` which will let you let away with such things. However, that is a bad idea. Instead, you should try to understand what is happening and come up with a solution like we did with `safe_get`.

# Interfacing with Streams

To print arrays, we can overload the `<<` operator:

```c++
template <typename ElementType>
std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &os, TypedArray<ElementType> &array)
{
    os << '[';
    for (int i=0; i<array.size(); i++ ) {
        os << array.get(i);
        if ( i < array.size() - 1 ) {
            os << ",";
        }
    }
    os << ']';
    return os;
}
```

This method is not declared inside the class definition, since it is not owned by `TypedArray`. In any case, now we can write:

```c++
TypedArray<TypedArray<double>> m;

for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {
    for (int j=0; j<3; j++) {
        m.get(i).set(j,0.5*i*j);
    }
}

std::cout << m << "\n";
```

which yields

```bash
[[0,0,0],[0,0.5,1],[0,1,2]]
```

The `<<` operator is called nine times. Three times with `TypedArra<double>` arguments, and for each of those times, three more times for `double` arguments. Since the `iostream` library defines `<<` for doubles, we do not need to do that. If we had an array of array of Imaginary numbers, for example, we would need to define `<<` for them as well.

# Introduction to Standard Template Library

## Sequential Containers

===

A _container class_ is one that contains some other class. Our `TypedArray` class is an example. A _sequential_ class is one in which the elements are stored and access sequentially, with indices 1, 2, ... and so on. The STL includes several templated sequential containers:

- `vector`: Like our `TypedArray` class, except you can't `get` elements at an index until something has been put at that index.
- `string`: A vector of characters with some special operations for manipulating strings.
- `array`: A fixed-size array whose size must be declared at compile time. No dynamic memory allocation, so possibly faster.
- `deque`: A double ended queue. Like a `vector` but optimized for adding elements to both ends (like our `TypedArray`).
- `list`: A doubly linked list.
- `forward_list`: A singly linked list.
  The most commonly used containers are `vector` and `string`, which we will cover here. The rest of the containers have fairly specialized uses, and many guides and textbooks advise that you simply don't use them, or that you prototype with 'vector' and 'string' and only switch to one of the more specialized classes if you can show it improves performance.

In the following notes, we will use `vector` and `string` for all of our examples. Many of the methods that act on these objects also act on the other ones.

# Constructors

To use the `vector` container, you need to first include it:

```c++
#include <vector>
using std::vector;
```

To make a new `vector`, you use the template sytnax we've already learned. For example

```c++
vector<double> t;          // vector of doubles
vector<Imaginary> u;       // vector of Imaginaries
vector<vector<double>> v;  // essentially a matrix of doubles
```

You can also initialize a `vector` when constructing it.

```c++
vector<int> t = { 1, 2, 3 };  // vector of three ints
vector<double> u(10,3.14);    // vector of 10 3.14s
vector<double> v = u;         // copy constructor with assignment operator
```

# Strings

In the STL, a `string` is a bit more than just a pointer to a `char` as with C. In fact, a `string` is a first class objects that is quite similar to a `vector`. Strings can be constructed and initialized similarly.

```c++
string s;
string t = "hello";
string u = t;
```

Note that the following code

```c++
vector<string> v = { "embedded", "systems", "are", "cool" };
```

involves the constructor for the `string` class, which takes a `char *` as an argument. Thus, although it may look like this snippet makes an array of `char *` values, it actually builds a `vector` of strings.

# Common Methods

Vectors and strings have many methods in common, since they are based on essentially the same code. You can test if they are empty, find their sizes, compare them, and get their individual elements. So for vectors, you can write:

```c++
vector<int> v = { 1, 2, 3 };
v.push_back(4);
v[0];      // 1
v.back();  // 3
v.front(); // 1
v.empty(); // false
v.size();  // 4
v == v;    // true
v > v;     // false
v.pop_back();   // changes the array to { 1, 2 } (returns void)
```

and for strings, you can write

```c++
vector<int> s = "abc";
s.push_back('d');
s[0];      // 'a'
s.back();  // 'c'
s.front(); // 'a'
s.empty(); // false
s.size();  // 4
s == s;    // true
s > s;     // false
v.pop_back();   // changes the array to { 1, 2 } (returns void)
```

The STL also defines the methods

```c++
s.clear();                    // clears the string
s.insert(s.begin()+1, 'x');   // insert an 'x' into position 1
q.erase(5,2);                 // remove two elements starting at position 5, reindexing subsequent elements
```

# Emplace

One method that can be useful is called `emplace`. It is used to construct new elements of the base type of, for example, a `vector`. This is needed because constructing elements and then pushing them into the vector can be cumbersome. Thus, if you have a class `Imaginary` with a constructor that takes two arguments, the real part and the imaginary part, you can do

```c++
vector<Imaginary> r;
r.emplace(r.begin(),2.0,3.0);
```

which creates a `vector` whose first element is the imaginary numer `2+3i`.

# Additional For Loop Form

A new for loop form is available in C++ as well, allowing you to interate over the elements in a sequential container easily. FOr example, to iterate over the characters in a string, you can do:

```c++
for ( char c : s ) {
    cout << c << "\n";
}
```

Or for a vector, you can write

```c++
vector<string> v = { "i", "am", "on", "a", "very", "bumpy", "flight" };
for (string s : v ) {
    cout << s << "!\n";
}
```

Note that the `for` pattern can request either a copy of the element, or a reference to it. You might want a copy if you are going to change the elements as you iterate through them, as in the following code:

```c++
vector<string> v = { "i", "am", "on", "a", "very", "bumpy", "flight" };
for (string &s : v ) {
    s.push_back('!');
}
```

The new `for` pattern uses the `:` operator. The sequential containers overload this operator to make this possible. If you define a new class, you can [overload this operator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8164567/how-to-make-my-custom-type-to-work-with-range-based-for-loops) for your new class as well.

# String Methods

Because strings are made of characters, it is often helpful to know the methods that are available for manipulating them.

```c++
int isalnum(int c);
int isalpha(int c);
int isblank(int c);
int iscntrl(int c);
int isdigit(int c);
int isgraph(int c);
int islower(int c);
int isprint(int c);
int ispunct(int c);
int isspace(int c);
int isupper(int c);
int isxdigit(int c);
int tolower(int c);
int toupper(int c);
```

Their names should be self-explanatory. These are in the library `<cctype>`.

For example, you can use the `toupper` method to convert a string to all caps:

```c++
for ( char &c : q ) {
    c = toupper(c);
}
```

# More String Methods

The string container also defines a number of string specific methods, such as `assert`, `append`, `replace`, `substr`, and `find` whose definitions are mainly self-explanatory. There are also a number of methods for converting between strings and numbers, such as `to_string` and `atoi`.

Interestingly, since vectors and strings are dynamic classes much like the `TypedArray` class we built earily, they have a capacity, which you can find with a simple method

```c++
v.capacity(); // some number bigger than v.size();
```

Also, if you need to keep the amount of space a sequential container takes up to a minimum, you can do:

```c++
v.shrink_to_fit();
```

# Iterators

Before the `for(x:v)` form was introduced, the way to iterate through containers like `vector` and `string` was to use an `iterator`. For example, the following code also changes all the characters in a string to caps:

```c++
for ( string::iterator i = q.begin(); i != q.end(); i++ ) {
    *i = tolower(*i);
}
```

Here, `q.begin()` returns an iterator that refers to the element at the beginning of the array, while `q.end()` refers to a non-element that is "one past" the end of the array. The notation `i++` is overloaded for iterators to mean "increment the iterator". Finally, the '\*' operator is overloaded to return a reference to the element the iterator refers to.

# Iterators with auto

Iterators are a good place to use the `auto` keyword. For example, an iterator to a vector of vector of doubles would be declared and initialized by

```c++
vector<vector<double>>::iterator i = v.begin();
```

and it is a lot easier (and clearer) to write

```c++
auto i = v.begin();
```

I suspect that usages similar to this one were the reason the `auto` keyword was introduced in the first place.

# Manipulating Indices

Iterators can be manipulated like indices into normal C arrays, via overloaded operators for `+`, `-`, `<`, and so on. For example

```c++
auto i = v.begin();
auto j = i + v.size() / 2;
i < j; // true
```

It should be noted that iterators are _not_ numbers. For example, if you do `cout << i`, you will get a compiler error because `i` is not some kind of number for which `<<` is defined, and furthermore, `<<` is not defined for iterators.

**Note:** If you would like to access the elements of a `vector` or `string` in reverse, you can use `v.rbegin()` and `v.rend()` methods. If a `vector` or `string` was declared `const`, you can use `v.cbegin()` and `v.cend()`, which return `const_iterators` instead of `iterators` (just use `auto` if you are unsure).

# Tuples

Sometimes you just need to hold a few values in a tuple. For example, you might want two integers, or a string and a double. Here is how you do that in C++ with a [tuple](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple).

```c++
#include <tuple>
#include <string>

...

using std;
tuple<int, int> x = make_tuple(123,234);
int a = get<0>(x); // 123
int b = get<1>(x): // 234
```

Notice the interesting use of templates in defining the type of `get`. In fact, `get` has something like this signature:

```c++
template< int I, class... Types >
typename std::tuple_element<I, tuple<Types...> >::type const&&
    get( const tuple<Types...>&& t );
```

It uses a size a plain old integer `I` in the template so that it can declare getters for tuples of any size with only one definition.

Please don't ask me what the `&&` operator does. Unless you would like to go on an hour long tangent about move semantics.

# Generic Algorithms

The STL uses function polymorphism to let you apply simple algorithms, such as finding and sorting, to pretty much any sequential container. One such method is called `find`. Here are a few examples:

```c++
vector<string> v = { "The", "quick", "brown", "fox" };
string s = "this is a string";
int a[10] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

auto f1 = find(v.begin(), v.end(), "quick");
cout << *f1; // "quick"

auto f2 = find(s.begin(), s.end(), 'i');
cout << *f2; // `i`

auto f3 = find(begin(a), end(a), 6);
cout << *f3; // 6
```

In the first two cases, `find` is using the `begin` and `end` methods of the `vector` and `string` containers. In the last case, we use the global methods `begin` and `end` to construct new iterators for the C style array `a`, which doesn't have any methods of its own.

The `find` algorithm works on _any_ object that defines `==`. Other algorithms, such as `sort` work on any object that defines `<`. That's whjy they are called _generic_.

# More Read Only Algorithms

Here are a few more _read only_ algorithms (ones that do not change their arguments) like find:

```c++
vector<int> v = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 },
            w = { 2,3,4,5,6,6,7,8 };
accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0);    // sum of elements in v
count(v.begin(), v.end(), 3);         // number of occurences of 3 in v
equal(v.begin(), v.end(), w.begin()); // true if first v.size() elements are equal to the
                                      // first v.size() elements of w, which must have equal
                                      // or greater length
```

These work equally well on any sequential container of values for which operations like `==` and `+` are defined.

Algorithms that change the underlying array, include things like `sort` and `fill`:

```c++
sort(v.begin(), v.end());                 // sort the elements
fill(v.begin(), v.end(), 1);              // replace element with third argument
fill_n(v.begin(), 3, 1);                  // replace three elements at the beginning with 1
copy(v.begin(), v.end(), w.begin() + 3);  // copy v into w starting at position 3
replace(v.begin(), v.end(), 3,-1);        // replace element at position 3 with -1
```

Further documentation on generic algorithms can be found [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/).

# Lambda Expressions

You can define functions as in two ways in C++. The first is the standard way, as in this example which squares its argument

```c++
double square(double x) {
    return x*x;
}
```

The other is with what are called `lambda` expressions, named after the _lambda calculus_ invented by Alonzo Church in the 1930s as a way to capture the essence of computation mathematically. A lambda expression defining the same function as above is:

```c++
[](double x) { return x*x; }
```

It is the same function, but it doesn't have a name. You can use evaluate lambda expressions by applying them like functions, as in:

```c++
([](double x) { return x*x; })(3.0); // 9.0
```

or you can set a variable equal to a lambda expression, and apply it later, as in

```c++
auto square = [](double x) { return x*x; }
square(3.0); // 9.0
```

# Using Lambdas with Generic Algorithms

Lambdas becomes useful when using generic algorithms, such as `transform`, which take functions as arguments:

```c++
vector<int> v = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
transform(
    v.begin(),    // start of elements to transform
    v.end(),      // end of elements to transform
    v.begin(),      // start of where to put elements to transform
    [](double x) { return x*x; }
);
```

Note that lambda expressions do not return function pointers. Rather, they return function _objects_, which are instantiations of a _function_ class which overrides the `()` application operator.

# Capturing Variables

The square brackets of a lambda expression can list variables to _capture_ from the surrounding scope. For example, if we define a function like this:

```c++
void add_to_all(vector<int> &v, int x) {
    transform(
        v.begin(),
        v.end(),
        v.begin(),
        [](int y) { return x+y; } // WRONG!
    );
}
```

the C++ compiler will complain that the lambda expression does not have access to the variable `x` in its scope. We can fix this by _capturing_ `x` as follows:

```c++
void add_to_all(vector<int> &v, int x) {
    transform(
        v.begin(),
        v.end(),
        v.begin(),
        [x](int y) { return x+y; } // RIGHT!
    );
}
```

# Callbacks

Sometimes you want to send a function to another function. For example, you might do

```c++
sleep_then(10, []() { cout << "Ten seconds have passed\n"; });
cout << "I am waiting\n";
```

If the sleep function executes in another thread waiting for ten seconds and then running its callback, then you would get the output:

```
I am waiting
Ten seconds have passed
```

We will get to code like this in a few weeks.

# Example Lambda as Argument

```c++
std::vector<int> map(std::vector<int> v, std::function< int(int) > f) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    for ( auto x : v ) {
        result.push_back(f(x));
    }
    return result;
}

TEST(Lambda, Argument) {
    std::vector<int> v = { 1,2,3,4,5 };
    auto f = [](int x) { return x*x; };
    std::vector<int> u = map(v, f);
    for ( auto x : u ) {
        std::cout << x << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n";
}
```

# Associative Containers

Associative containers are different from sequential containers in that they index the container with keys, kind of like a `struct`, dictionary, or database. The associative containers defined in the STL are 'map', 'set', 'multimap', and 'multiset'. We will focus here on 'map', which can be used to illustrate the main features.

In a `map`, a set of keys are used to index a set of values. For example, you might define a `map` as follows:

```c++
   map<string,string> person;
   person["First"] = "Alan";
   person["Last"] = "Turing";
   person["job"] = "Code breaker";
```

Note that the `map` template takes two types, the key type and the value type. They do not have to be the same:

```c++
    map<string, vector<int>> sequence;
    sequence["ints"] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
    sequence ["squares"] = { 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 };
    sequence["fib"] = { 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 };
```

or another (inefficient) way to make an array of doubles

```c++
map<unsigned int, double> a;
a[0] = 123;
a[5] = 34;
int x = a[3]; // 0. Non-existent keys map to default values of the value type
```

Some implementations of Javascript actually look something like this for arrays.

# Map Iterators

You can iterate through the keys and values of a `map` with iterators. The order in which the iterators visit the elements of the map is not guaranteed, so do not depend on it. For example, using the definition of `m` above,

```c++
for(auto i = person.begin(); i != person.end(); i++) {
    cout << (*i).first << ": " << (*i).second << "\n";
}
```

which can also be written

```c++
for(auto i = person.begin(); i != person.end(); i++) {
    cout << i->first << ": " << i->second << "\n";
}
```

When you dereference an iterator in a `map` you get a `pair` object (also defined by the STL). It will have the same types as the map. In the above example, `*i` as the type `pair<string,string>`. The pair object has a `first` and `second` field that references to the actual key and value of the map to which the iterator refers.

You can erase key/value pairs from a map using either keys or iterators.

```c++
m.erase("First");
m.erase(m.begin());
```

# DB Example

To illustrate how to use the various STL containers, we will build a simple database class for storing information about celestial bodies. The class will support:

- Construction of a new database
- Insertion of a new planet name, mass (in earths) and distance (in astronomical units).
- Assigning entries unique keys
- Deletion of a database entry
- Finding an entry by key
- Search the database with a lambda

The code for this example is in `examples/db.cc`, `examples/db.h`, and `examples/db_tests.cc`.

# DB Example: Public Methods

The methods described above are declared formally below.

```c++
class DB {

    // Rows in the database will be of the form
    // [key,name,mass,distance]
    typedef tuple<int,string,double,double> Row;

    DB();
    DB &insert(const string, double, double);
    DB &drop(int);
    Row find(int) const;
    vector<Row> where(function<bool(const Row)> f) const;

};
```

Note the `typedef` allows us to avoid writing out the entire `tuple` definition over and over again.

Also note the use of `const` on the string argument, and in `find` and `where`.

# DB Example: Underlying Implementation

Hidden from the user, we need to actually store that data somewhere. One way to do that is with an associative map that makes integer keys to tuple values.

We will also need a counter for the keys.

```c++
class DB {

  // ...

  private:

    typedef tuple<string,double,double> Value;
    map<int,Value> _data;
    int _next_key;

};
```

Note that it is customary to prefix private variables with an underscore.

# DB Example: The constructor

In `db.cc` we implement all the methods, starting with the constructor, which just sets the key counter to zero. Since we are using the STL library, we do not need to do any memory allocation.

```c++
DB::DB() : _next_key(0) {}
```

# DB Example: Insertion

To insert an entry, we compute a key, then map that key to a new tuple that contains the value.

Note we return `*this` so we can method chain.

```c++
DB &DB::insert(const string name, double mass, double distance) {

    int key = _next_key++;
    _data[key] = make_tuple(name, mass, distance);
    return *this;

}
```

# DB Example: Drop

To drop the entry corresponding to a given key, we use map's `find` method. It returns an iterator, which we have to make sure is not pointing to `end()`.

Note we return `*this` so we can method chain.

```c++
DB &DB::drop(int key) {

    auto e = _data.find(key);

    if ( e != _data.end() ) {
        _data.erase(e);
    }

    return *this;
}
```

# DB Example: Find

To find an entry with a given key, we use map's `find` again. If no such entry is found, an exception is thrown.

```c++
DB::Row DB::find(int key) const {

    auto e = _data.find(key);

    if ( e != _data.end() ) {
        return to_row(key,e->second);
    } else {
        throw runtime_error("Could not find an entry with the given key");
    }

}
```

This method has to convert the tuple found in the map to a row so it can return it to the user. To make this cleaner, we have defined a private `to_row` function as follows:

```c++
DB::Row DB::to_row(int key, const DB::Value value) const {
    return make_tuple(key, get<0>(value), get<1>(value), get<2>(value));
}
```

Note the use of tuple's templated `get` method.

# DB Example: Where

Where is pretty interesting. We have to collect all the rows for which the supplied function evaluates to true.

```c++
vector<DB::Row> DB::where(function<bool(const DB::Row)> f) const {

    vector<Row> rows;

    for( auto [key, value] : _data ) {
        auto row = to_row(key,value);
        if ( f(row) == true ) {
            rows.push_back(row);
        }
    }

    return rows;

}
```

# DB Example: Testing

Here are a few tests.

```c++
TEST(DB,Basics) {

    DB db;

    db.insert("earth", 1, 1)
        .insert("mars", 0.11, 1.524)
        .insert("moon", 0.011, 1.05)
        .insert("exoplanet one", 1, 1054.4)
        .insert("jupiter", 318, 5.2);

    ASSERT_EQ(NAME(db.find(0)), "earth");

    auto rows = db.where([](DB::Row row) { return  MASS(row) < 1; });

    ASSERT_EQ(rows.size(), 2);

    try {
        db.drop(2)
            .find(2);
        FAIL();
    } catch ( runtime_error e ) {
        ASSERT_STREQ(e.what(), "Could not find an entry with the given key");
    }

}
```

Note that the macros KEY, NAME, MASS, and DISTANCE have been defined for convenience:

```c++
#define KEY get<0>
#define NAME get<1>
#define MASS get<2>
#define DISTANCE get<3>
```
